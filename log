If you set two distinct areads in eeeprom for the wifi creds then you can read the ends by finding the trailing 0.

Actually you don't even need to do that, just take the two strings and put them in 1 space apart, and they'll be seperated by a single 0 in memory.

Also look into persistent wifi cred and see if you can use those instead as it might be way easier.
